I am a lecturer (assistant professor) at the [Information School](http://sheffield.ac.uk/is/) of [The University of Sheffield](http://sheffield.ac.uk/).

I hold a PhD in Information Science from the University of Strathclyde, which I completed in 2011, and since then have worked in academic roles in the UK, Germany and Switzerland. Before coming to Sheffield, I was a senior lecturer at Northumbria University in Newcastle and a research associate at the University of Lugano in Switzerland and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany. 

My work aims to bridge the gap between “systems” and “user-centred” Information Retrieval and Recommender Systems. I conduct research in the fields of information retrieval, information behaviour, recommender systems and in the wider area of information and data science and have published more than 60 peer-reviewed conference papers and journal articles.

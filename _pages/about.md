I am a lecturer (assistant professor) at the [Information School](http://sheffield.ac.uk/is/) of [The University of Sheffield](http://sheffield.ac.uk/).

My current areas of interest for research revolve around developing systems allowing people to effectively model and utilise the data sources they interact with every day and understanding how they interact with this data. I received my PhD in 2011 from the University of Strathclyde under the supervision of Ian Ruthven. I worked as a post-doc researcher in the Artificial Intelligence Research Group at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Before taking up my current position at Northumbria in January of 2015 I did a second post-doc with Fabio Crestani at the University of Lugano (USI).
